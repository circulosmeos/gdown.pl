gdown.pl
========

Google Drive direct download of big files

Requirements
============

*wget* and *Perl* must be in the PATH.   
**Windows** and **linux** compatible.

Usage
=====

Use Google Drive shareable links, viewable by anyone:   

    $ ./gdown.pl 'gdrive file url' ['desired file name']   

Example
=======

For example, to download [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1L_hFrWJfRhLUJZdXdSdTdfSWs/edit) from my [axolotl project](https://circulosmeos.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/axolotl-a-simple-plain-text-documentation-system/), just copy the url, and give a file name if desired:

    $ ./gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1L_hFrWJfRhLUJZdXdSdTdfSWs/edit axolotl.mp4   

As long as a file name is indicated as **second parameter**, `gdown.pl` **will try to resume the partially downloaded file** if an incomplete file with that name already exists. Please note that for this to work, wget must correctly provide `--spider` with `--server-response` (`-S`). `wget` v1.17 at least is advised.

Version
=======

This version is **v2.2**.

### Warning

Please, note that v1.2 (available between days 12 to 31 of Jan/2019) **should not be used**, as it contains a bug that could result in unusable downloaded files. Proceed to overwrite with v1.4 in case you have it.

Docker
======

A simple Docker file is provided, to build a simple Docker image with gdown.pl.    
This has been used for pre-pulling data from a Google Drive to Kubernetes persistent volumes.    
Thanks @anton-khodak

Singularity
===========

An example [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.2/user-guide/quick_start.html) file is provided.    
Build the container:
`sudo singularity build (imagename) Singularity`

Run the container:
`singularity run (imagename) (gdown.pl args)`

Thanks to @ttbrunner
